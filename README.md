# StatusApp
This is a POC I created for an application that I ultimately extended for an application for a project that I work on. I developed this entirely on my own time and used it as a way to learn Spring Boot.
The application is a dashboard that shows which servers are up and which are down for various application environments (QA, DEV, PROD, etc.). 

This is the dashboard -

For each environment, a secondary page can be opened where more details on the environment are available such as links to the App UI, links to the management console and so on. In my real version of this, I extended these links to be links to logs and other specifics.
