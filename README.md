# StatusApp
This is a POC I created for an application that I ultimately extended for an applcation for work. I developed this entirely on my own time and used it as a way to learn Spring Boot.
The application is a dashboard that shows which servers are up and which are down for various application environments (QA, DEV, PROD, etc.). For each environment, a secndary page can be opaned where more details on the environment are available such as link to the App UI, a link to the console and so on. In my real version of this, I extended these links to be links to logs and other specifics.
